# MovieTut
A React-based movie search app that fetches data from a public movie API. Users can browse through movies, search by title, and mark their favourite ones. The favourites are saved locally, providing a simple yet interactive user experience. This project demonstrates API integration, state management with React hooks, and dynamic UI rendering.
